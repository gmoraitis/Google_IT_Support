# History of Computing

### From Abacus to Analytical Engine
- A computer is a device that stores and processes data by performing calculations.

- Abacus is one of the earliest known computers

- The first major step forward was the invention of the mechanical calculator in the 17th by Blaise Pascal. It was limited to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division for pretty small numbers. 
- In the 1800s, a man by the name of Joseph Jacquard invented a programmable loom.
-  Babbage built what was called a difference engine. Babbage's follow up to the difference engine was a machine he called the Analytical Engine. It took the powerful insights of a mathematician named Ada Lovelace to realize the true potential of the analytical engine. She was the first person to recognize that the machine could be used for more than pure calculations. She developed the first algorithm for the engine. It was the very first example of computer programming. 
- An algorithm is just a series of steps that solves specific problems.


### The Path to Modern Computers
- Cryptography is the art of writing and solving codes
- A magnetic tape worked by magnetizing data onto a tape
- The ENIAC was one of the earliest forms of general purpose computers
- The very first compiler was invented by Admiral Grace Hopper.Compilers made it possible to translate human language via a programming language into machine code
- Eventually, the industry gave way to the first hard disk drives and microprocessors
- Then in the 1970s, a young engineer named Steve Wozniak invented the Apple I, a single-board computer MIT for hobbyists. With his friend Steve Jobs, they created a company called Apple Computer.
-  In the 1980s, IBM introduced its personal computer. It was released with a primitive version of an operating system called MS DOS or Microsoft Disk Operating System.
- With huge players in the market like Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows taking over the operating systems space, a programmer by the name of Richard Stallman started developing a free Unix-like operating system. Unix was an operating system developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, but it wasn't cheap and wasn't available to everyone.
- Stallman created an OS that he called GNU. It was meant to be free to use with similar functionality to Unix. Unlike Windows or Macintosh, GNU wasn't owned by a single company, its code was open source which meant that anyone could modify and share it. GNU didn't evolve into a full operating system, but it set a foundation for the formation of one of the largest open source operating system, Linux, which was created by Linus Torvalds

## Digital Logic
### Computer Language
- The communication that a computer uses is referred to as binary system, also known as base-2 numeral system.This means that it only talks in 1s and 0s.
- In computing terms, we group binary into 8 numbers, or bits. Technically, a bit is a binary digit
-  A group of 8 bits is referred to as a byte. A byte of zeroes and ones could look like 10011011. Each byte can store one character, and we can have 256 possible values, thanks to the base-2 system, 2 to the 8th. In computer talk, this byte could mean something like the letter C.

### Character Encoding
-  Character encoding is used to assign our binary values to characters so that we as humans can read them.
- The oldest character encoding standard used this ASCII
- Then came UTF 8. The most prevalent encoding standard used today

### Binary
- Imagine we have a light bulb and a switch that turns the state of the light on or off. If we turn the light on, we can denote that state is one. If the light bulb is off, we can represent the state is zero. Now imagine eight light bulbs and switches, that represents eight bits with a state of zero or one.

### How to Count in Binary
- Imagine that we have the following binary number 00001010 and we want to convert it to a decimal number.We check to see what ones are switched on.2+8 = 10.

## Computer Architecture Layer
### Abstraction
- We use the concept of abstraction to take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use.
- One other simple example of abstraction in an IT role that you might see a lot is an error message. We don't have to dig through someone else's code and find a bug.
### Computer Architecture Overview
-  A computer can be cut into four main layers, hardware, operating system, software, and users.
- The hardware layer is made up of the physical components of a computer
-  The operating system allows hardware to communicate with the system
-  The software layer is how we as humans interact with our computers
- The last layer may not seem like it's part of the system, but it's an essential layer of the computer architecture, the user.
